  ## Description

  I started this project by basing it off of the CatsApp, the last classwork assignment prior to the homework. It helped tremendously cut down the amount of code I had to write for this assignment but I did still have to change it to fit with what was needed for this homework. I started by editing the sql file with what I would need for this assignment the name of the burger and whether or not it was devoured. I then went into the other files and changed the references to match the new database that I had created, before going into the handlebars and editing the structure of the files to match the format of what I needed for the burgers app. Once I finished editing the handlebar formats so that it would appear as what I wanted I moved onto the css and added some slight changes to it before linking bootstrap to my app to make it easier to make the rows and columns I needed. Finally I attempted to deploy to heroku but even after linking it with my github accound and adding on the JAWSDB MySQL, I could not get it to appear when deploying from heroku.
